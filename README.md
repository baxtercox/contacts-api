# contacts-api

Hello this application was built using Java and springboot, the IDE I used was intellij and the Database used was mySQL workbench, in order to use this application 
clone the repo and Run your Java server and open your browser to localhost:8082/login. You should see something like the following image: <img width="1066" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-05 at 3 06 35 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69552028/110167884-649ced00-7dc4-11eb-842d-16fb352fe601.png">

once youve logged in you can go to the localhost:8082/dashboard page and see the contacts youv've added. I tested the GET, POST, DELETE, PUT routes in insomnia <img width="1149" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-05 at 3 10 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69552028/110168310-fefd3080-7dc4-11eb-80dd-ff1fc30cfd5d.png">
